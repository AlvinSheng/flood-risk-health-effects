Summarizing sensitivity analysis, in list format
•	Including more PC such that 90% of the variance is accounted for
•	Using the original flood risk variables selected by a VIF-based procedure
•	Remove certain sets of variables, i.e., social vulnerability indices, weather variables, pollution variables, etc. 
•	Fit non-spatial models
•	Stratify analysis by Poverty and/or other variables that may interact with flood risk
  o	Stratify on Poverty (above/below median), leaving the other SVI variables as is
  o	Stratify on each of the four themes (above/below median) using the RPL_THEME1, RPL_THEME2, RPL_THEME3, RPL_THEME4 (the percentile rankings for the theme), leaving the other SVI variables as is
Stratify on RPL_THEMES (above/below median)
•	use a two-stage propensity score adjustment in the models
	o	The spatial propensity score (labelled "S+P" in the review) seems to be a reasonable approach.  A complication for you is that there are multiple treatments, one for each PC.  But for the purpose of a sensitivity analysis you could just include the propensity score for the first PC because that's the only one that appears to have an effect.
•	use low and high climate scenario for the flood risk variables as well as mid

•	Fit a Poisson CAR model rather than a Gaussian CAR
